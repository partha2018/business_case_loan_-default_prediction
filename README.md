# Loan Default Prediction and Evaluation Criteria

## Problem Statement:

The candidate needs to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using a machine learning
model. This model should consider a variety of factors that potentially influence a borrower's ability to repay
a loan, such as income, employment status, credit score, loan amount, interest rate, and other relevant
variables. The prediction model should also handle data imbalances, missing values, and outliers effectively.
Second, the ability to address the problem, including the understanding of the problem, the proposed
solution, the ability to build a predictive model, and the understanding of machine learning algorithms, data
analysis, data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model evalua1on methods.

## Goal:

The goal of the problem is to predict whether a client will default on the vehicle loan payment or not. For
each ID in the Test_Dataset, you must predict the “Default” level.
